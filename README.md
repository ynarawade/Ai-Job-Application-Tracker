# AI-Powered Job Application Tracker

An AI-powered job application status tracker that helps developers track, organize, and manage job applications — all in one place.

---

## Problem

As developers and students, we apply to multiple jobs and internships across different platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages, and referrals.

Common challenges include:

- Tracking applications using Excel or notes becomes messy over time
- Difficulty remembering where and when applications were submitted
- No clear visibility into application statuses
- Lack of insights and reminders
- No intelligence — just raw, unstructured data

While spreadsheets work initially, they are **not sustainable** for managing a long-term job search.

## Solution

This application provides a **centralized, structured, and intelligent platform** to manage job applications efficiently.

Key benefits:

- Track all job applications in a single dashboard
- Store essential details such as:
  - Company name
  - Job type (Internship / Full-time)
  - Pay
  - Applied date
  - Application status
  - Platform
  - Duration
  - Notes
- Easily filter, update, and monitor application progress
- Maintain clarity and organization throughout the job search

With AI integration (current and planned), the app enhances tracking by:

- Summarizing job descriptions
- Organizing application-related information
- Laying the foundation for smarter job search assistance

## Goal

The goal of this project is to replace spreadsheets with a **modern, scalable, and developer-friendly solution** that evolves with your job search — from simple tracking today to intelligent automation in the future.
